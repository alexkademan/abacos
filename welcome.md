# Welcome!

We’re excited you’re considering ourcondo for your next getaway!
We absolutely love the Bahamas and you will too!

Treasure Cay, Abacos, is a great community with easy access to golf cart car and bike rentals for touring the island. Our condo is in close proximity to rental boats, charter boats and ferry services for ‘island hopping’ to some great out islands. Grocery and liquor stores are within walking distance as is the Tipsy Seagull Bar & Grill and Spinnakers Restaurant. For golf enthusiasts, the Treasure Cay 18 Hole Golf Course, designed by Dick Wilson, is considered a must. If chilling out on the beach is your preference, its just a short short walk to the 3.5 mile long Treasure Cay Beach – rated one of the top ten beaches in the region with its powder white sand and stunningly tranquil turquoise water!

When you arrive, the condo will be ready for your stay. A welcome binder for your review can be found on the counter. The information provided will be helpful and will ensure you have a great time during your stay.

We only rent to friends, family and ‘friends of’ friends & family. So, once you arrive just kick back and relax – you’re in the Bahamas now!

Enjoy your stay! Bill & Jenny Raninen
