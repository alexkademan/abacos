[Treasure Sands Restaurant / Bar][treasure-sands] – Located just outside of Treasure Cay Gates, so you’ll need a driver or use a golf cart. Fine dining with a great menu – a really beautiful location with a great view. Dress is evening casual to dressy – your choice. Bring your swim suit there’s an awesome pool!

[Tipsy Seagull][tipsy-seagull] – Just a short walk from the condo. You will know everyone by days end here! The pool is great and relaxing. Be sure to bring a sharpie to write your message somewhere at Tipsy! Thursdays are pizza night and it can get pretty busy so order up fast!

[Spinnakers][spinnmakers] – this is located next door to Tipsy Seagull. A great ‘walk to’ restaurant with a good menu.

[Touch of Class Restaurant][touch-of-class] – This restaurant is located just outside of gated Treasure Cay but just give them a call and they’ll come and pick you up! (good luck trying that in the states!) The menu is good - we recommend the coconut grouper its awesome!

Beach Club – This bar & restaurant is located right on the edge of the beach. Great place to eat when you don’t want to leave the water and powder white sand!

[Treasure Cay Golf Course][golf] –  Located within the gated community but you’ll need a golf cart to get to it. This championship 18 hole golf course was designed by Dick Wilson. Call ahead to reserve tee time!
