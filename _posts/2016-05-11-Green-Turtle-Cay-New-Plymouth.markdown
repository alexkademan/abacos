Rent a golf cart (we recommend Kool Karts) and go in search of the bars and restaurants. Miss Emily’s Blue Bee Bar is a must stop and its right there where you get off from the ferry and by the Kool Karts rentals. Careful if you try the Goombay Smash – its pretty powerful, especially if you two! Pineapple Bar is close and also a fun stop for a drink or maybe a conch burger. The Bluff House is a bit of a journey but lots of fun – you’ll need that golf cart!
