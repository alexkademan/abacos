Take the Ferry from Marsh Harbour. They may be providing ferry service from Treasure Cay on Sundays but this is not yet certain so you may want to ask around. Nippers (go to your right from the docks and follow the signs – its within walking distance) is one of the most popular tourist bar and grill stop. Its on a bluff overlooking a great beach and the ocean. It can get pretty busy and its always a party here! Sundays is their Hawaiian style Pig Roast which is the most popular day to go. Grabbers Sunset Bar is a great stop also (go left from the docks) – order a Guanna Grabber drink and relax or grab a paddle board and take it out for a spin.

Be sure you are aware of what time the ferry leaves – if you miss it you may be staying the night!
