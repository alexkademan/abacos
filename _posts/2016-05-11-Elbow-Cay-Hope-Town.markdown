If you rent a boat we recommend stopping at [Tahiti Beach][tahiti]. Great spot to stop and hang out on the sand bar.

Besides Marsh Harbour, Hope Town is your best shopping option for quant little shops.

Take a tour of the candy red and white striped [famous kerosene Lighthouse built in 1887][lighthouse]. Be ready to walk up those stairs! This is manually operated and one of only three in the world!

Hope town is full of shops, bars and restaurants. You’re bound to find a good time!
