If you rent a boat we recommend stopping at [Tahiti Beach][tahiti]. Great spot to stop and hang out on the sand bar.

Besides Marsh Harbour, Hope Town is your best shopping option for quant little shops.

Take a tour of the candy red and white striped [famous kerosene Lighthouse built in 1887][lighthouse]. Be ready to walk up those stairs! This is manually operated and one of only three in the world!

Hope town is full of shops, bars and restaurants. Youâ€™re bound to find a good time!
